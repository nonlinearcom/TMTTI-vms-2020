		<p class="intro">
			In 1948 the world was gifted with one of the most important and
			significative literature masterpieces: 1984 by George Orwell. The
			dystopic scenario described by the author was undoubtedly influenced by
			the Second world war which had devastated the globe not only in a
			material way – with bombs and armed conflicts – but also in an
			ideological and psychological way, since it saw the success of several
			tyrannies and non-democratic governments.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most surprising aspect of the Orwellian novel was the modernity the
			author staged: telescreens, cameras and other devices were used by the
			government in order to guarantee the full control on the society of the
			new city of London. These systems were so sophisticated for that time
			and people read the book thinking about something impossible to reach,
			both for the technological innovations and for the re-born of such a
			tyrannical scenario able to change global rules and the world we are –
			and they were – used to know.
		</p>

		<p>
			But the most astonishing thing is that George Orwell – who died in 1950
			– was right about the technological progresses the majority of the
			global population would have faced during the years; additionally, he
			was right about the fact these new technological devices would have been
			used by several societies to control their people – in a more or less
			hided way. Moreover, tyrannies haven’t disappeared throughout history
			and there still are countries veering among governments which don’t
			really give the opportunity to exercise the basilar freedoms of the
			human being.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, today, we still have this masterpiece in our library, and it’s very
			difficult to believe it has been written so many years ago, since it
			seems to describe our contemporary society, where you’re controlled even
			if you’re apparently living in a democratic country.
		</p>

		<h2 class="highlighted-text color__surveillance ">
			From our phones to grocery stores kiosks to traffic lights, cameras are
			watching us and they’re here to stay.

		<p>
			From our phones to grocery stores kiosks to traffic lights, cameras are
			watching us and they’re here to stay. Governments, law-enforcement
			agencies, tech companies are more and more using facial recognition to
			track who we are in public space. In an age when technology knows us
			better than we know ourselves, you might be asking: how can we hide?
			<a id="topnote1" href="#note1" class="note note__surveillance">1</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s to answer this question that different personalities in different
			business fields have started involving themselves. Particularly, in the
			fashion field, there have been a lot of designers who have made
			available their production activities to guarantee the security and,
			above all, the privacy of the customers during their social lives. From
			this desire, was born what we currently call Anti-surveillance fashion:
			it’s about a way of doing fashion – including make-up, hair dressing and
			clothing and the usage of other technological devices – with the main
			objective of hiding the identity of people in front of public cameras,
			making them able not to be over-controlled and continually recognized.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s an example of some designers - among many others - who have
			decided to dedicate their productions to the anti-surveillance fashion:
		</p>

			CV Dazzle <a id="topnote2" href="#note2" class="note note__surveillance">2</a> is an open source
			anti-facial recognition toolkit that explores how fashion, specifically
			hair and makeup, can be used to camouflage one’s self from new
			technologies. CV Dazzle was a project created by Adam Harvey
			<a id="topnote3" href="#note3" class="note note__surveillance">3</a> as part of his NYU Master’s thesis
			in 2010 and is ongoing. Using low-cost methods, CV Dazzle works by
			manipulating the expected dark and light areas of a face in relation to
			what computer vision algorithms look for when identifying objects. The
			designs can be easily achieved using hair styling, makeup and fashion
			accessories. The idea behind CV Dazzle is simple: facial recognition
			algorithms look for certain patterns when they analyse images, so
			obstructing those patterns means obstructing the ability for the
			algorithm to recognise you. Techniques to do this include creating
			asymmetry, using hair to conceal the face (particularly the nose
			bridge), using make-up that contrasts with your skin tone in unusual
			tones and directions, and sticking gems on the face.

			REALFACE Glamoflauge offers a series of garments designed specifically
			to confuse Facebook’s facial recognition software that automatically
			tags your face in photos. Fashioned by Simone C. Niquille
			<a id="topnote4" href="#note4" class="note note__surveillance">4</a>, this project was synthesized from
			her Master’s thesis in 2013. The t-shirt’s pattern is composed of images
			taken from the public, typically celebrity faces, and remixes them in a
			bizarre and bold design that confuses facial recognition technology.
			Instead of identifying your face, these t-shirts will keep Facebook’s
			algorithms figuring out who exactly they’re looking at.

		<p>
			The CHBL Jammer Coat <a id="topnote5" href="#note5" class="note note__surveillance">5</a> was designed by
			architecture firm Coop Himmelb(l)au in 2014 for the exhibition “Abiti da
			lavoro.” It exists to distract, deter and diffuse surveillance
			technology from recognizing your existence in any space. The CHBL Jammer
			Coat is made of metallized fabrics that block radio waves and shield the
			wearer against tracking devices. While the garment keeps you safe from
			radio frequency identification (RFID) readers that steal credit card
			information, it will also make you unreachable on your mobile device, so
			it’s for you to decide whether the protection is worth dropping out of
			touch. The fabric pattern is comprised of dots of various sizes in a
			wave formation creating a “vibrating” sort of look to the coat. Its
			waviness is so visually busy, cameras don’t detect it.

		<p>
			Wearable projector <a id="topnote6" href="#note6" class="note note__surveillance">6</a> is a wearable
			headgear, from a collection titled Anonymous from 2017, which projects
			different faces on top of your own as you walk around in public. As if
			your face were a screen, this projector gives you a new appearance by
			constantly shifting through different looks. As with other anti-facial
			recognition wearables, this projector alters the appearance of your
			face, making your true identity undiscoverable to cameras. The headgear
			also works while you are moving. In fact, it further implements the
			“shakiness” of the flashing images, making your face even less
			detectable. On top of the constant shifting through images, the
			brightness of the projection confuses computer vision algorithms.

		<p>
			Urme surveillance (pronounced “you’re me”) is a collective dedicated to
			protecting the public from surveillance by providing various products
			that conceal a person’s true identity. It was a crowd-funded project
			created by artist Leo Selvaggio <a id="topnote7" href="#note7" class="note note__surveillance">7</a> in
			2014. His goal was to make anti-surveillance available to all,
			especially to those participating in protests all over the world.
			Anti-surveillance attempts in the early 2010s were typically limited to
			altering the appearance of your face or completely hiding it with
			full-face ski masks (balaclavas). Selvaggio offers another way of hiding
			from cameras by supplying everyone with his own face. Therefore, rather
			than computer vision algorithms identifying your true identity, by
			wearing a URME mask, computers will identify Leo Selvaggio instead.

		<h2 class="highlighted-text color__surveillance ">
			Altering people's appearance to cheat cameras has become increasingly
			popular with artists and designers in recent years -
		</h2>

		<p>
			Computers have become adept at identifying people in recent years,
			unlocking myriad applications for facial recognition, from tracking
			criminals to counting truants. Altering people's appearance to cheat
			cameras has become increasingly popular with artists and designers in
			recent years, as the use of facial recognition has grown more pervasive,
			raising fears over privacy, according to fashion experts.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, anti-facial recognition fashion has also drawn some criticism,
			with one academic saying it risked "normalising" surveillance. "These
			artworks are accepting pervasive surveillance as being inevitable," says
			Torin Monahan, a professor of communication at the University of North
			Carolina at Chapel Hill <a id="topnote8" href="#note8" class="note note__surveillance">8</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to the critics, anti-surveillance fashion wouldn’t be used
			only by people in pacific protests and in non-democratic governments,
			but it will be also used by criminals to escape from controls, police
			and legal persecutions.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, which is the usage that will prevail over? Are these items going to
			be used for worthy causes or for helping out some criminals?
